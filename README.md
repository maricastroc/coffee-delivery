## 📚 Project Description
In this project, I developed an application to manage a shopping cart for a fictional coffee shop, with the following functionalities:

- List of products (coffees) available for purchase
- Add a specific amount of items to the cart
- Increase or remove the amount of items in the cart
- Form for the user to fill in his address
- Display the total items in the cart in the Header
- Display the total value of the sum of items in the cart multiplied by the value

## 📌 What did I learn?

In this project, I had the opportunity to practice working with many of ReactJS features, using styled-components, contexts, reducers, immers, routing with React Router DOM, ReactHook Form and hookform/resolvers, using zod for validation. Also, I was able to work deeper with TypeScript, allowing a better organization project's files and preventing bugs.

I was able to establish a much more organized and efficient communication logic between the components through contexts and reducers, and I practiced organizing files in different folders, following a pre-established hierarchy, giving special importance to code refactoring to facilitate readability and maintenance.

In addition, I could practice using hooks like useDebounce and useMemo, as well as creating my own useLocation hook using the Geolocation API.
